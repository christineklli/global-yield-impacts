# About this repository

This repository contains all code used to generate SSP5-RCP8.5 estimates
for the manuscript, "Predicting changes in agricultural yields from
climate change scenarios and their implications for global food
security" (April 27, 2023). The separate repositories used to estimate
outputs for SSP1-RCP2.6 and SSP2-RCP4.5 can be made available upon
request. All analysis was performed in the R.4.2.2. environment.

## Scripts

This repository uses the `targets` framework for reproducible workflow
developed by [William Landau](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/). The
script `_targets.R` describes the targets pipeline as a modular list of
smaller, nested target pipelines that are stored inside all scripts with
`targets_` prefixes in the `scripts/` folder. The target pipeline as a
whole describes the dependencies between targets (i.e. cached objects).
We recommend that users become familiar with the targets pipeline and
associated `targets` commands in the link provided, but users only need
to use `tar_make()` to run the pipeline and build targets, or
`tar_make_future()` to build targets using parallelisation. As the
targets pipeline takes care of dependencies, users can create the entire
targets pipeline with `tar_make()` or create individual targets `x` with
`tar_make(x)`.

Users should first run `scripts/init.R` to install packages and set the
relative file path dependencies to the root project folder.

## Data

The validated CGIAR dataset is saved in `processed/agimpacts_final.csv`.
Certain data inputs, such as observational and projected temperature,
precipitation and CO2 data, spatial crop production, calendar
information and food security data exceed Github's repository size
limits. Please refer to the list below and additional details in the
manuscript to download data directly from cited sources and deposit
these in the directory structure that has been set up and outlined in
the targets pipeline or contact me for assistance.
